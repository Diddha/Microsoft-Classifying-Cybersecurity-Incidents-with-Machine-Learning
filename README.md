üö®Microsoft: Classifying Cybersecurity Incidents with Machine Learningüîê - Updated Description
Project Overview
The Classifying Cybersecurity Incidentsüö® initiative leverages machine learning to streamline the operations of Microsoft Security Operation Centers (SOCs). This project centers on developing a robust classification model to predict the triage grade of cybersecurity incidents accurately. By doing so, it empowers SOC analysts to prioritize critical issues, enhancing their ability to address threats efficiently.

The incident classification includes:

True Positive (TP): A validated threat.
Benign Positive (BP): A harmless alert.
False Positive (FP): An incorrectly flagged threat.
